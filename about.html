<h2>What is Crochet?</h2>

<h2>About My Journey!</h2>
	<p> I learned how to crochet for the first time from my Grandma Diana, and I only knew how to make a really long chain. Although not entirely useful for projects, it made a great cat toy! I picked up a hook again my Junior year of college and have barely put it down ever since. Thanks to a friend, i discovered a hobby that I have stuck with for over a year, and you could love it too!</p>
<h2>My Life</h2>
	<p> Born and raised in small town Nebraska, I have always loved to stay home wrapped in a blanket with a good book and maybe a cat or two in my lap. When the weather is nice I also like to travel outdoors. I am also a beginner at plant keeping and hope to keep each of my green friends alive for some time, even if my three cats, Jasper, Magnus, and Hazel, try to eat them. </p>
