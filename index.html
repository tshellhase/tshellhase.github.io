<h2>Welcome to My Closet!</h2>
	<p> As a crafter, I have learned my fair share of hobbies throughout my life thus far. However, the one that stole my heart is crocheting. Many of the projects I complete end up sitting in my closet, but they deserve to be enjoyed, so come browse my closet!</p>
<h3>Let's Crochet Together</h3>
	<p> As someone who is young and crochets, I am no stranger to being called a 'grandma' when working on my projects. Instead of letting this get to my head, I want to break the stigma and make sure everyone has access to this amazing hobby. I offer classes or just a simple hangout place for those who want to learn, or already know how, to crochet.  </p>
